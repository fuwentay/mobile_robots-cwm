## Mobile Robots - Coursework Module

### Motivation
The modern world is full of systems such as cars, mobile phones and washing machines that have small, embedded computers built into them. Programming such computers requires techniques that are different to those required for a personal computer or a workstation. This module gives you the opportunity to discover what these techniques are and gives you some experience in programming such devices.

This course work builds on the introduction to microcontrollers (single-chip computer systems with on-chip hardware) you had in your first-year Electrical Laboratory. The object of the course is to program a small mobile robot to follow a course set out on the floor avoiding obstacles. To do this you will learn how to connect a computer to sensors such as a simple camera and write out information to control things such as electric motors. You will also learn how to synchronise a program with events happening in the real world as opposed to a virtual reality.

Programming is in the C programming language, using the MCUXpresso interactive software development system that you used in the first-year Electrical lab. You will spend the whole week Designing, Building and Testing programs to operate the robot. You do not need to be an expert programmer, the only prior knowledge you need is P5 Computing.

### Learning Objectives
• Use the C programming language.
• Program a microcontroller.
• Manipulate data at a bit level.
• Connect to sensors such as a camera and control things such as motors.
• Understand how to use microcontroller data sheets.
• Use an oscilloscope to look at signals from sensors.
